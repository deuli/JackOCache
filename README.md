Jack o'Cache is a mod all about collecting various pumpkins. There are currently ***30*** different pumpkins to collect that can be obtained by either killing a mob or by transforming a pumpkin. Some even have a unique model!


# Get Started

To first get started with the mod, you will need a new weapon that allows you to collect the new pumpkins. The **Jack o'Slicer** is a new weapon that harnesses the power of Halloween to transform pumpkins to give them new looks.

The **Jack o'Slicer** has two ways to obtain pumpkins. The first one is by killing mobs. If the player kills a mob while having pumpkins in their inventory, the mob will have a chance to drop a special pumpkin.

The second way is by transforming a pumpkin. A pumpkin block can be right clicked using the **Jack o'Slicer** which will convert it into another pumpkin based on certain conditions, such as blocks around it and the dimension it is in.

# Jack o'Lanterns
Of course, every pumpkin is able to be crafted into a jack o'lantern variant using a torch.
