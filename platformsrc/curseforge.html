    Jack o'Cache is a mod all about collecting various pumpkins. There are currently <em><strong>40</strong></em>
    different pumpkins to collect that can be obtained by either killing a mob or by transforming a pumpkin. Some even
    have a unique model!
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Get Started</h2>
<p>
    To first get started with the mod, you will need a new weapon that allows you to collect the new pumpkins. The
    <strong>Jack o'Slicer</strong> is a new weapon that harnesses the power of Halloween to transform pumpkins to give
    them new looks
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Jack o'Slicer</strong> has two ways to obtain pumpkins. The first one is by killing mobs. If the player
    kills a mob while having pumpkins in their inventory, the mob will have a chance to drop a special pumpkin.

</p>
<p>
    The second way is by transforming a pumpkin. A pumpkin block can be right clicked using the <strong>Jack
    o'Slicer</strong> which will convert it into another pumpkin based on certain conditions, such as blocks around it
    and the dimension it is in.

<h2>Jack o'Lanterns</h2>
<p>
    Of course, every pumpkin is able to be crafted into a jack o'lantern variant using a torch.
